# Crypto-Price-Interactive
Things like Block chain, Bitcoin, Bitcoin cash, Ethereum, Ripple etc are constantly coming in the news articles I read. So I wanted to understand more about it.  How many cryptocurrencies are there and what are their prices and valuations? Why is there a sudden surge in the interest in recent days? So what next?
The dataset has one csv file for each currency. Price history is available on a daily basis from April 28, 2013. This dataset has the historical price information of some of the top crypto currencies by market capitalization.
Date : date of observation
Open : Opening price on the given day
High : Highest price on the given day
Low : Lowest price on the given day
Close : Closing price on the given day
Volume : Volume of transactions on the given day
Market Cap : Market capitalization in USD
The dashboard helps me to understand the other factors related to Cryptocurrency prices and also help me to make future predictions in a better way than just using the historical price.
